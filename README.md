## What I Learned

I appreciate the ease of using template literals to structure and print text. I first created a sample README.md file containing all of the headers and content needed, and then could copy and paste each part where it was needed into the code.

I learned the importance and usefulness of documentation for resources like Inquirer. There were many options available for questions - I was easily able to find the best fit for the information I wanted to gather to build a README.

One challege I faced was accidentally pushing up a copy of a generated README file, writing over the README for this repo, because of a mistake in naming the new file in the index.js file. This was fixed by adding "sample-" in front of the new README.md file name.

## Usage

You can run this application by typing the following into your terminal:

```
node index.js
```
And then follow the prompts to enter the content you wish to include in your README.
